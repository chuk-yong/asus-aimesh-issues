# asus-aimesh-issues
Setting up Asus AIMesh with AX-88u (main) and AC-86u (node).

Issues:
- Sync always fail.  Even if the node is nearby, detected and the status bar goes past 40%.
  I just cannot make them work over wifi.  So use Ethernet cable to link the two.  Plug into the broadband port for the node, in my case the AC-86u.  Once detected, go through the sync process.

- After setup, the node fails to communicate either immediately or after a few weeks
  After sync, you will be able to manage the node (AC-86u) via the app or web.  Make sure the preferred uplink is set to 'WIFI' and not auto.  You can then power it down and move it to another spot.

Just make sure you have the latest firmware for both.  Whether it is a merlin version does not matter.
